# Welcome to sphinx-contribs's documentation!

This is actually working!! Right now it's pulling contribs however
from a online GitHub repo. And i think we want this to work on the repo
in the current envt potentially? i'm not sure

but right now its grabbing repo contribs for index.md from our online
packaging guide index.md file.
